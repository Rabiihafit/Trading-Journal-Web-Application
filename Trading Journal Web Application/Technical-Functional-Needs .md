# Technical Functional Needs (Phase 2 – Design)

## • Account / Role

→ Manages security, user rights, and authentication.

- **Account (User):** contains personal information, email, password, creation date, and last login.  
- **Role:** defines access level (e.g., Trader, Administrator) and associated permissions.  

📌 **Goal:** separate identity, permissions, and active session management.

---

## • Portfolio / MarketAccount

→ Allows the trader to manage multiple trading environments.

- **Portfolio:** groups trades by logic (strategy, capital, or goal).  
- **MarketAccount:** represents a real or demo trading account (e.g., MT5, Binance, BrokerX).  

📌 **Each user can own multiple accounts and portfolios to separate performance tracking.**

---

## • Trade / Position / Order

→ Core structure for all recorded trading operations.

- **Trade:** represents a complete trade (entry/exit, profit, status).  
- **Position:** describes open or closed positions (long/short, size, leverage, open/close price).  
- **Order:** represents executed or pending orders (market, limit, stop, etc.).  

📌 **Clear distinction between the “final trade” and “intraday orders” that compose it.**

---

## • Strategy / Tag

→ Manages trading strategies and categorization.

- **Strategy:** stores the name, description, and parameters of a trading method.  
- **Tag:** allows categorization of trades or strategies with custom filters (setup, instrument, timeframe, etc.).  

📌 **Used to compare performance by approach and simplify filtering.**

---

## • ImportJob / ExportJob / LogImport

→ Handles and tracks all data exchanges.

- **ImportJob:** records automatic imports (MT5, CSV files, etc.) with status (pending/ok/error).  
- **ExportJob:** tracks exports (PDF, Excel, CSV) with date, format, and file link.  
- **LogImport:** logs errors, warnings, and import details.  

📌 **Ensures traceability and debugging for external data synchronization.**

---

## • Attachment (File)

→ Manages files attached to a trade or note.

- **Attachment:** contains filename, MIME type, size, URL, and upload date.  

📌 **Allows adding screenshots, charts, reports, or documents to the journal.**

---

## • Report

→ Manages generated reports automatically or on demand.

- **Report:** records the report type (performance, comparison, summary), date, and file link.  

📌 **Allows saving and accessing detailed analysis reports generated by the system.**

---

## • Notification / AuditLog

→ Handles system communication and action security.

- **Notification:** informs the user about system events (import completed, report ready, error alerts).  
- **AuditLog:** keeps track of sensitive actions (trade deletion, export, login, profile update).  

📌 **Enhances transparency and system security.**

---

## • Statistic / StatMetric / Dashboard

→ Analyzes and visualizes user performance.

- **Statistic:** groups data over a defined period (number of trades, total profit, drawdown, win rate).  
- **StatMetric:** stores individual metrics (expectancy, average per trade, profit/loss ratio).  
- **Dashboard (optional):** defines how data and charts are displayed for the user.  

📌 **Enables tracking and comparison of performance over time.**

---

## • Instrument (extended)

→ Defines traded financial assets.

- **Instrument:** contains symbol (e.g., XAU/USD), market type (Forex, crypto…), and preferred timeframe.  

📌 **Used to organize statistics and filter trades by market or instrument.**

---

## • UserSetting

→ Manages customization and user preferences.

- **UserSetting:** stores theme, language, currency, and notification preferences.  

📌 **Provides a personalized and consistent user experience.**
